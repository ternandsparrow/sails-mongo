This is a fork so we can have case-insensitive waterline queries.
It's a bit risky to depend on someone else's fork so we've taken our own copy, plus we can add in updates from upstream.

All the good stuff is on a branch: https://github.com/ternandsparrow/sails-mongo/tree/case-insensitive-plus-track-balderdashy

Currently this is being used by:
